# Portfolio

## Description

I've always wanted to be able to program my own website, having the ability to do so has been a major motivation factor.
I built this project to provide potential future employers with a portfolio website to view some of my best works.
This mini-project solves the issues of me lacking a respectable portfolio.
Across the creation of this website I learned a tremendous amount, as nothing teaches better than to actually apply the knowledge.
